\emph{The noble horse with courage in his eye,}\\
\emph{clean in the bone, looks up at a shellburst:}\\
\emph{away fly the images of the shires}\\
\emph{but he puts the pipe back in his mouth.}\\
\emph{Peter was unfortunately killed by an 88;}\\
\emph{it took his leg away, he died in the ambulance.}\\
\emph{I saw him crawling on the sand, he said}\\
\emph{It's most unfair, they've shot my foot off.}\\

\emph{How can I live among this gentle}\\
\emph{obsolescent breed of heroes, and not weep?}\\
\emph{Unicorns, almost,}\\
\emph{for they are fading into two legends}\\
\emph{in which their stupidity and chivalry}\\
\emph{are celebrated. Each, fool and hero, will be an immortal.}\\
\emph{These plains were their cricket pitch}\\
\emph{and in the mountains the tremendous drop fences}\\
\emph{brought down some of the runners. Here then}\\
\emph{under the stones and earth they dispose themselves,}\\
\emph{I think with their famous unconcern.}\\
\emph{It is not gunfire I hear, but a hunting horn.}\\
