\postepi{

What do you want from me\\
you who walk towards me over the long floor\\
\bigskip
your arms outstretched, your heart\\
luminous through the ribs\\
\bigskip
around your head a crown\\
of shining blood\\
\bigskip
This is your castle, this is your metal door,\\
these are your stairs, your\\
\bigskip
bones, you twist all possible\\
dimensions into your own\\
