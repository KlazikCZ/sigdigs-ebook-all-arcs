Turkey.  It is ruled by an elite class known as the *sakellarioi* (in
continuity with the Byzantine state from which it descended), although
nominally headed by a single powerful *Strategos*.  They are relatively
poor when compared with the rest of the world, and the two dominant
languages are Greek and Turkish.  They have belligerent relations with
**Cyprus**.

Caucasus
:   Magical Caucasus is officially a single magical state
north of **Cappadocia**, but in practice is a fractious conglomeration
of small regions with little to unite them but convenience.  Delegate
status to the **International Confederation** is frequently doled out as
a sop to potential rivals of local strongmen, and in practice the
Caucasus tends to lean heavily in favor towards Russia and the European
contingent.

Pensieves and a variety of exhilarating or pleasurable memories to

for being one of the areas where the magical world is wholly out of sync
with the Muggle world's borders.

:   A purpose-built prison for magical Britain, created
to replace Azkaban after its destruction at the end of 1992.

International Confederation of Wizards
:   The international assembly

noted for having an excellent reporting staff with top-notch
investigations accompanied by entirely deluded editorials.

Minister for Magic
:   Purportedly the leader of the government of
magical Britain, although the Minister for Magic has historically been
secondary to whomever has the greatest support in the Wizengamot, thanks
to a governmental structure that strongly favors the legislative branch
over the executive one.  Recent Ministers in chronological order have
been: Millicent Bagnold, Bartemius Crouch, Cornelius Fudge, Rufus
Scrimgeour, Pius Thicknesse, Junius Simplewort Smith, and Carmel N'goma
(the current Minister).

at the **Tower**.  The process is done by any of the available healers
and certified in every case by Harry Potter himself.  Most typically,
applicants are restored to the best approximation of their youthful self
(usually at the rough physiological age of 25).  There is a tendency for
distinctive features to be lost or altered during the process, although
this can be minimized if the applicant brings sufficient pictures of
themselves when young.

Returned, The
:   A small group of witches and wizards who work under
the direction of **Hermione Granger**.  They have several aims, but
their paramount purposes are the elimination of Dementors and the end of
suffering in the world.  They do not lack ambition.  Also see

sapling at the centre of a sacred clearing in the Forbidden Forest near
Hogwarts, in the northwest of their designated lands.  The Sprig remains
the same, year after year, never maturing from its sapling stage.

form a rough center to their community.

Satomi's Dogs
