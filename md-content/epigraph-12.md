<div class="postepi">
Between the acting of a dreadful thing\
And the first motion, all the interm is\
Like a phantasma, or hideous dream:\
The genius and the mortal instruments\
Are then in council; and the state of men,\
Like to a little kingdom, suffers then\
The nature of an insurrection.

<cite>William Shakespeare</cite>
