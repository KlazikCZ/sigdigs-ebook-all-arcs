’Twas I, my lord, that gat the victory;\
And therefore grieve not at your overthrow,\
Since I shall render all into your hands,\
And add more strength to your dominions\
Than ever yet confirm’d th’ Egyptian crown.\
The god of war resigns his room to me,\
Meaning to make me general of the world:\
Jove, viewing me in arms, looks pale and wan,\
Fearing my power should pull him from his throne:\
Where’er I come the Fatal Sisters sweat,\
And grisly Death, by running to and fro,\
To do their ceaseless homage to my sword:\
And here in Afric, where it seldom rains,\
Since I arriv’d with my triumphant host,\
Have swelling clouds, drawn from wide-gaping wounds,\
Been oft resolv’d in bloody purple showers,\
A meteor that might terrify the earth,\
And make it quake at every drop it drinks:\
Millions of souls sit on the banks of Styx,\
Waiting the back-return of Charon’s boat;\
Hell and Elysium swarm with ghosts of men\
That I have sent from sundry foughten fields\
To spread my fame through hell and up to heaven:\
And see, my lord, a sight of strange import, —\
Emperors and kings lie breathless at my feet;\
