America how can I write a holy litany in your silly mood?\
I will continue like Henry Ford my strophes are as individual as his automobiles\
more so they're all different sexes.\
America I will sell you strophes $2500 apiece $500 down on your old strophe America free Tom Mooney\
America save the Spanish Loyalists\
America Sacco & Vanzetti must not die\
America I am the Scottsboro boys.\
America when I was seven momma took me to Communist\
Cell meetings they sold us garbanzos a handful per\
ticket a ticket costs a nickle and the speeches were free\
everybody was angelic and sentimental\
about the workers it was all so sincere you\
have no idea what a good thing the party was\
in 1835 Scott Nearing was a grand old man a\
real mensch Mother Bloor the Silk-strikers'\
Ewig-Weibliche made me cry once I saw the\
Yiddish orator Israel Amter plain. Everybody\
must have been a spy.\
America you don't really want to go to war.
