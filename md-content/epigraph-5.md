<div class="postepi">
O house which is a ziggurat, grown together with heaven and earth,\
foundation of heaven and earth, great banqueting hall of Eridug!\
Abzu, shrine erected for its prince, house which is the holy mound where pure food is eaten,\
watered by the prince's pure canal, mountain,\
pure place cleansed with the potash plant,\
abzu, your tigi drums belong to the divine powers.

Your great wall is in good repair.\
Light does not enter your meeting-place where the god dwells, the great assembly-room,\
the assembly-room, the beautiful place.\
Your tightly constructed house is sacred and has no equal.\
Your prince, the great prince, has fixed firmly a holy crown for you in your precinct\
O Eridug with a crown placed on your head,\
bringing forth thriving thornbushes,\
pure thornbushes for the susbu priests,\
O shrine which is the abzu,\
your place,\
your great place!
