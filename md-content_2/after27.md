*The noble horse with courage in his eye,*\
*clean in the bone, looks up at a shellburst:*\
*away fly the images of the shires*\
*but he puts the pipe back in his mouth.*\
*Peter was unfortunately killed by an 88;*\
*it took his leg away, he died in the ambulance.*\
*I saw him crawling on the sand, he said*\
*It's most unfair, they've shot my foot off.*\

*How can I live among this gentle*\
*obsolescent breed of heroes, and not weep?*\
*Unicorns, almost,*\
*for they are fading into two legends*\
*in which their stupidity and chivalry*\
*are celebrated. Each, fool and hero, will be an immortal.*\
*These plains were their cricket pitch*\
*and in the mountains the tremendous drop fences*\
*brought down some of the runners. Here then*\
*under the stones and earth they dispose themselves,*\
*I think with their famous unconcern.*\
*It is not gunfire I hear, but a hunting horn.*\
