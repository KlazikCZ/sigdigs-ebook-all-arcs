Wiglaf maðelode, Wihstanes sunu:\
“Oft sceall eorl monig anes willan\
wræc adreogan, swa us geworden is.\
Ne meahton we gelæran leofne þeoden,\
rices hyrde, ræd ænigne,\
þæt he ne grette gold-weard þone,\
lete hyne licgean, þær he longe wæs,\
wicum wunian oð woruld-ende;\
heold on heah gesceap.\

Wiglad, son of Weohstan, spoke:\
“Often when one man follows his own will\
many are hurt.  This happened to us.\
Nothing we advised could ever convince\
the prince we loved, our land’s guardian,\
not to vex the custodian of the gold,\
let him lie where he was long accustomed,\
lurk there under earth until the end of the world.\
He held to his high destiny.\
