<div class="postepi">
What do you want from me\
you who walk towards me over the long floor\\

your arms outstretched, your heart\
luminous through the ribs\

around your head a crown\
of shining blood\

This is your castle, this is your metal door,\
these are your stairs, your\

bones, you twist all possible\
dimensions into your own\
