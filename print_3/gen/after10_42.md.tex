\emph{I think we are in rats' alley}\\
\emph{Where the dead men lost their bones.}\\

\emph{``What is that noise?''}\\

\emph{The wind under the door.}\\

\emph{``What is that noise now?''}\\
\emph{What is the wind doing?''}\\

\emph{Nothing again nothing.}\\

\emph{``Do you know nothing?''}\\

\emph{``Do you see nothing?''}\\ 

\emph{``Do you remember nothing?''}\\

\emph{I remember}\\

\emph{Those are pearls that were his eyes.}\\

\emph{``Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?''}\\
