\emph{Cromwell, our chief of men, who through a cloud}\\
\emph{Not of war only, but detractions rude,}\\
\emph{Guided by faith and matchless fortitude,}\\
\emph{To peace and truth thy glorious way hast ploughed,}\\
\emph{And on the neck of crowned Fortune proud}\\
\emph{Hast reared God's trophies, and his work pursued,}\\
\emph{While Darwen stream, with blood of Scots imbrued,}\\
\emph{And Dunbar field, resounds thy praises loud,}\\
\emph{And Worcester's laureate wreath: yet much remains}\\
\emph{To conquer still; Peace hath her victories}\\
\emph{No less renowned than War: new foes arise,}\\
\emph{Threatening to bind our souls with secular chains.}\\
\emph{Help us to save free conscience from the paw}\\
\emph{Of hireling wolves, whose Gospel is their maw.}\\
