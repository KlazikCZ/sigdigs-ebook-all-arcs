<div class="postepi">
No time hath she to sport and play:\
A charmed web she weaves alway.\
A curse is on her, if she stay\
Her weaving, either night or day,\
To look down to Camelot.\
She knows not what the curse may be;\
Therefore she weaveth steadily,\
Therefore no other care hath she,\
The Lady of Shalott.

She lives with little joy or fear.\
Over the water, running near,\
The sheepbell tinkles in her ear.\
Before her hangs a mirror clear,\
Reflecting tower'd Camelot.\
And as the mazy web she whirls,\
She sees the surly village churls,\
And the red cloaks of market girls\
Pass onward from Shalott.
